      <h1 class="w3-center">Quantum Minesweeper</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">Oct 2022 - Oct 2022</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Devised a 2D Grover's search algorithm for two dimensional searches within the time constraints of hackathon "KTHack'22".
        Developed a reduction algorithm that examines the coordinate system 16x16, making the search algorithm 16 times faster.
        Leveraged quantum algorithms to improve upon conventional coordinate-based search techniques, resulting in an alternative method for locating targets.
        Earned recognition and the secondary prize at "KTHack'22" for pioneering approach and successful implementation of the quantum-enhanced search algorithm.
        Continuously refined and advanced the algorithm post-hackathon for expanded practical applications.</p>
